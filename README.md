The website I have developed is aimed at people who like to avoid work and prefer to be lazy. My idea is to ironically point out to these people that they can google their problems themselves. The website generates from a search term for the problem from the lazy user and creates a link that they can share with their friends or colleagues. When they open the link, a fake Google page is displayed that animatedly searches the pre-determined search term. In this way, I want to show the lazy users that they can find answers to their questions through a simple Google search without relying on others.
